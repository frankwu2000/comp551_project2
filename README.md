Machine learning project
  
 - Overview  
This is a course project for Applied Machine Learning.  
The project used Decision Tree learning to classify different language used for each sample.  
This decision tree learning used information gain to determine priority of all possible split/creating tree node.

 - Data preprocessing
For the input training data, TF-IDF is used to convert train_set_x and test_set_x into sparse matrix with all the character they used as feature.
